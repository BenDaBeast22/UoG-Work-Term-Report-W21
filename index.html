								The purpose of this website is to document my experiences at all of my co-op work-term
								placements during my time at the University of Guelph. Currently as of December 2021,
								I have completed my first co-op work term at an engineering consultancy company called
								Hatch as a junior software developer. I am now going into my third semester as a
								computer science student and plan to update this website after every new work-term.

								<h2>About My Job</h2>

							<div class="left-align-p">
								<p>
									&emsp;At Hatch I was employed as a junior developer in the Digital Solutions sector. 
									In essence my job was to update and modify numerous web applications used by 
									Hatch.
								</p>
								<p>
									&emsp;During the first couple weeks of my work-term I 
									was tasked with implementing a static code analysis security program called Checkmarx 
									into all of Azure Devops QA pipelines. This required me to study Checkmarx documentation 
									and preform a great deal of problem solving to reduce the amount of time the code analysis took to run 
									for each pipeline. <em>Below is an image of the Checkmarx interface:</em>
								</p>

										This is where I adjusted the settings to get the QA pipeline linked to Checkmarx:
									</em>
								</p>
								<span class="image featured info-image"><img src="images/azureDevops.png" alt=""/></span>
	
								<p>
									&emsp;The following two months another co-op student and I were assigned to revamp a 
									website called the Estimate Governance register which was used by Hatch as a tool
									for estimating projects. The app consisted of a home page, a user friendly page with a form to add 
									projects to the app and a results page with a table to list all of the project data such as the 
									lead estimator, cost and location for the project. The main technologies that we used to upgrade the app 
									were Angular, Typescript and CSS for the front-end and the .Net framework and 
									C# for the backend. Moreover we worked on upgrading the app’s authentication from ADAL to 
									MSAL and implementing NGRX to add state management to the application. Finally, we improved the table
									by implementing AG-Grid (a customizable data grid) to the results page of the application. This improved the 
									readability of the data and allowed more features to sort and organize data. We also added AG-Grid to the home
									page with a subset of the most relevant data for easy access. 
								</p>

								<p>
									&emsp;During the final month I worked with the same co-op student to upgrade the UI 
									on another app called DataMart and fix various small bugs. At the very end of the 
									term I worked on the documentation for all of the apps that I worked on. 
									<em>

								<h2>Goals and Learning Outcomes</h2>
							</header>

							<div class="learning-goals">
								<p>
									During the work term I came up with <em>3 learning goals</em> that I believed would make me a better
									software developer in the future and would help enhance my abilities in areas that I was missing from University.
									The <em>3 goals</em> were to:
								</p>

								<div class="list-container">
									<ol>
										<li>Learn the Angular Framework and related tools relevant to the job (C#, .Net Framework, Azure Devops, etc).</li>
										<li>Improve my teamwork skills as a software developer.</li>
										<li>Refine my presentation and oral communication skills.</li>
									</ol>
								</div>

								<div class="goals-explained">
									<h3>
										<strong>Goal #1</strong>
									</h3>
									<hr>
									<p>
										&emsp;During my co-op work-term I wanted to improve my ability at learning 
										new technologies since software developers must be able to 
										adapt depending on the project they are working on. I specifically 
										wanted to become proficient with the Angular framework since I have never 
										used it before and it is one of the most popular front-end frameworks for 
										creating websites. 
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;To achieve my goal of learning a new framework I studied the angular 
										documentation, read a number of blogs on angular concepts online and got my 
										more experienced teammate to look over my code and offer improvements. 
										Moreover, to put my learning into practice I decided to create my very 
										own angular application using all of the concepts and technologies that 
										I learned at my workplace. 
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;At the end of my work term the app I decided to create is a gacha game 
										simulator where you use currency to obtain randomized characters. The app 
										consists of a landing page, the simulator page where you obtain characters 
										and an inventory page where you can view the characters you collected. This 
										app improved my front-end skills in angular and I learned how to incorporate 
										a database into my application to store the characters and user login 
										information below you can find a link to the front-end of my application hosted
										on Github.
									</p>

									<h3>
										<strong>Goal #2</strong>
									</h3>
									<hr>
									<p>
										&emsp;Another area I wanted to improve on during my work term was my 
										teamwork skills as a software developer since the majority of real world applications are developed
										by large teams of developers. Unfortunately, at university most of my 
										courses were entirely focused on individual tests and assignments. 
										As a result, before my work-term I had very little experience working with 
										others in a software environment.
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;To achieve my goal of improving my teamwork skills I met with my teammate everyday 
										where we set goals and discussed how we would complete our assigned stories in a timely manner. 
										Additionally we would communicate with each other when we needed help, and when something was 
										out of our grasp we would set up a meeting with someone else in the company or with our supervisor
										to efficiently solve the problem at hand. Moreover, we did a good job of splitting up the work amongst ourselves. 
										As a result of good communication, knowing when to ask for help and effectively separating our work we were able 
										to complete all of our stories and projects in a timely manner. 
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;I was able to achieve my goal of becoming a better team player and as the semester progressed 
										my teammate and I were able to tackle more challenging stories and were able to complete our stories 
										much quicker than at the beggining of the work term as we became better at working together.
									</p>

									<h3>
										<strong>Goal #3</strong>
									</h3>
									<hr>
									<p>
										&emsp;The final goal that I set for my work term was to brush up my presentation skills by
										the end of the co-op work term since at school I had limited experience sharing my 
										work and ideas in front of my peers. Specifically when I presented I wanted to become
										more confident, explain myself more clearly and be more concise with my explanations.
										This would help me in future jobs be better at clearly communicating my work and ideas 
										to teammates and clients so they can understand and learn from my presentations and discussions.
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;To achieve my goal of improving my presentation skills I developed good presentation habits
										by taking notes before meetings to organize my thoughts so that I could express myself more clearly
										and concisely. Moreover I practiced presenting the tasks I completed, what I was going to work on 
										next and the problems I was facing everyday in front of my teammate at each standup. 
									</p>

									<p>
										&emsp;I put my practice into action for a presentation to the client about all of the features my teammate
										and I implemented on for our first application after we finished it. I created a small slide-show with bullet points 
										for the changes we implemented to the application and took notes to expand on all of the points that I made 
										as well as how to demo the changes in front of the client. When I presented I was able to clearly express all 
										of the changes we made to the application along with the demos that I performed to illustrate of each change.
